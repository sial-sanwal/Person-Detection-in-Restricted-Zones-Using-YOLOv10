# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a YOLOv10n model for detecting persons in a video and monitoring a restricted area. The model processes each frame of the video, detects persons, and counts the number of persons in a specified restricted area. The results are displayed on the video with bounding boxes and a counter indicating the number of persons in the restricted area.

# Features
- Person Detection: Detects persons in each frame of the video.
- Restricted Area Monitoring: Counts the number of persons within a specified restricted area.
- Visual Feedback: Draws bounding boxes around detected persons and overlays the count on the video.
- Customizable: Easily modify the coordinates of the restricted area to fit your needs.
# Demo
A demo video showing the functionality of the project is included. You can view the processed video to see the model in action.
